				<string>Behaviour \n\n• At age 4½, 30% of children still wet the bed, 21% infrequently (less than two times per week) and 8% of these more frequently. \n\n• Research indicates that while 27% of toddlers are fussy eaters, 22 per cent of them have parents who admit to being fussy eaters too.</string>
				<string>Psychological Issues \n\n• 90% of 10-month-old infants will become upset if a stranger approaches them in an unfamiliar room. Only 50% will become upset if the child is given time (10 minutes) to become familiar with the room (Sroufe et al., 1974). \n\n• According to Early Childhood Australia, separation anxiety usually starts at about six to eight months of age and lasts until about two and a half to four years of age. \n\n• It is estimated that about 10-15% of children/teens are depressed at any given time. \n\n• Approximately 3%-8% of all children and adolescents have a depressive disorder. \n\n• Approximately 60% of children with major depressive disorder will also meet the criteria for an additional mental health illness. \n\n• According to Thomas J. Huberty, PhD, NCSP Indiana University, the frequency of anxiety disorders ranges from about 2-15% of children and occurs somewhat more often in females. \n\n• 3.3% children and young people have an anxiety disorder. \n\n• ADHD afflicts approximately 3-10% of school-aged children and an estimated 60% of those will continue to have symptoms that affect their functioning as adults. \n\n• ADHD affects males at higher rate than females in childhood.</string>

Just over 75% of high school students have tried alcohol. Half of all teenagers feel pressured by their peers about sexual activity. \n\n• In a survey conducted by Survelum Public Data Bank, students felt pressured by their peers around 35-49% of the time.</string>
				<string>Body Image \n\n• Among high school students, 44% of girls and 15% of boys are attempting to lose weight. \n\n• More than 40% of boys in middle school and high school regularly exercise with the goal of increasing muscle mass. \n\n• 5% of girls with low self-esteem reported engaging in negative activities like cutting, bullying, smoking, drinking, or changes in eating patterns</string>

				<string>Anxiety \n\n• According to National Institute of Mental Health, women are more likely than men to experience an anxiety disorder over their lifetime. \n\n• According to US National library of Medicine, mild to extremely severe anxiety symptoms were present in 24.4% of the population, and generalized anxiety disorder in 19.0%.</string>
				<string>Stress \n\n• 75% of adults report experiencing moderate to high levels of stress. \n\n• 80% of workers feel stress on the job and nearly half say they need help in learning how to manage stress. And 42% say their co-workers need such help (American Institute of Stress). \n\n• Women report higher levels of stress than men. \n\n• Money (69%) and work (65%) are found to be the leading sources of stress.</string>
				<string>Addiction \n\n• An estimated 42.1 million people, or 18.1% of all adults (aged 18 years or older), in the United States smoke cigarettes. Cigarette smoking is more common among men (20.5%) than women (15.8%). \n\n• Cigarette smoking is the leading cause of preventable death in the United States, accounting for more than 480,000 deaths, or one of every five deaths, each year. \n\n• 87.6% of people ages 18 or older report that they consumed alcohol at some point in their lifetime \n\n• In 2012, 3.3 million deaths, or 5.9% of all global deaths (7.6% for men and 4% for women), were attributable to alcohol consumption. \n\n• Alcohol contributes to over 200 diseases and injury-related health conditions, most notably alcohol dependence, liver cirrhosis, cancers, and injuries. In 2012, alcohol accounted for 5.1% of disability adjusted life years (DALYs) worldwide. \n\n• Globally, alcohol misuse is the fifth leading risk factor for premature death and disability; among people between the ages of 15 and 49, it is the first.</string>
				<string>Relationship \n\n• A recent study on cohabitation concluded that after five to seven years, only 21% of unmarried couples were still living together. (The Boston Herald) \n\n• 55% of cohabitating couples get married within five years of moving in together. (Annual Review of Sociology) \n\n• Children of divorced parents have a higher risk of divorce when they get married and an even higher risk if the person they marry comes from a divorced home. (Journal of Marriage and the Family) \n\n• According to a research published by Dr. Markman in 2010 in the Journal of Family Psychology, about a 20% increase in negative communication (in about 5 years) was observed in the communication pattern of couples who were dissatisfied in marriage. \n\n• About 24% of men and 14% of women have had sex outside their marriages, according to a Dec. 21, 1998 report in USA Today on a national study by the University of California, San Francisco. \n\n• Around 54% men and 42% women are dissatisfied with their current frequency of sex. (Smith A, et. al.) \n\n• A 26-year-long study by Terri Orbuch found that when a husband reported having a close relationship with his wife\&apos;s parents, the couple\&apos;s risk of divorce decreased by 20%. \n\n• 29.6% of the individuals separated from their spouse report feeling lonely, as compared to 20.6% widowed, 20.4% divorced, 14.5% never married and 4.6% married.
