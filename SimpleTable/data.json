                "Anger management prevents you from saying or doing something in your anger that you will later regret. Rather, it involves calming yourself, making cool-headed assessments of the situation, and finally taking sensible action. With practice, this can be accomplished in a matter of seconds.",

It's when a person feels a sadness which is so severe it interferes with everyday life, and causes symptoms such as loss of appetite, sleeping issues, loss of concentration and/or low energy levels. Depression also lasts longer than a bout of sadness."],

But as times passes, something happens, and that person goes from being a voluntary drug user to being a compulsive drug user. Why? Because over time, continued use of addictive drugs changes your brain — at times in dramatic, toxic ways, at others in more subtle ways, but virtually always in ways that result in compulsive and even uncontrollable drug abuse.",
                "Virtually no one wants to undergo de-addiction. Two of the primary reasons people seek de-addiction are because the court ordered them to do so, or because loved ones urged them to seek treatment. Many scientific studies have shown convincingly that those who enter addiction treatment programs in which they face “high pressure” to confront and attempt to surmount their addiction comparatively do better in treatment, regardless of the reason they sought treatment in the first place.",
